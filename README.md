# About Project
# Hotel Reservation Management System (Website)

A full-stack hotel reservation web application developed with **Django (MVT Architecture)**. The project provides a complete hotel management experience, including room management, secure user authentication, reservation processing, reservation validation, and an administration panel.

The frontend template is based on a modern design from **themewagon.com**, which has been extensively customized and extended with additional pages and backend integration.

## Access Level Management

The backend completely separates guest accounts from management accounts.

During login, the backend validates user permissions.

A regular guest **cannot** log into the management section.

Management accounts **cannot** log in through the guest login page.

All invalid login attempts are properly handled and meaningful error messages are displayed.

User roles are displayed inside each user's profile.

Supported user roles:

* Guest
* Staff
* Manager

Only management accounts can access the Django Administration Panel.

---

## Hotel Management

Hotel information is fully dynamic.

Administrators can manage:

* Hotel Information
* Contact Information
* Gallery Images
* Rooms
* Reservations
* Users

using the Django Admin Panel.

---

## Room Info In Database

* Room Name
* Room Number
* Room Image
* Guest Capacity
* beds info
* Price Per Night
* Is sale Status
* Sale Price Per Night

## Reservation System

One of the main goals of this project was implementing a complete backend reservation logic.

The reservation system validates every submitted reservation before saving it.

Implemented validations include:

* Empty arrival date validation
* Empty departure date validation
* Room availability validation
* Room service status validation
* Arrival date cannot be in the past
* Arrival date must be before departure date
* Accurate reservation overlap detection
* Maximum reservation period (30 nights)
* Automatic stay duration calculation
* Automatic reservation price calculation
* Sale price calculation

Only valid reservations are stored in the database.

---

## Reservation Overlap Detection

The backend prevents multiple guests from reserving the same room during overlapping time periods.

The overlap validation has been fully implemented using Django ORM queries and accurately detects conflicts between reservation date ranges.

---

## User Profile

Each authenticated user has access to a personal profile page.

Users can:

* View account information
* Edit account information
* Change password
* View all reservations
* View reservation details
* Cancel any reservation

---

## Administration Panel

Managers can manage the entire website through Django Administration.

The administration panel provides full CRUD functionality for:

* Users
* Hotel Information
* Rooms
* Reservations
* Gallery Images

---

# Frontend

The frontend template was originally obtained from:

https://themewagon.com/

The template has been customized and extended to fit the requirements of this project.

Several new pages and backend integrations were implemented.

# Pages

The website contains the following pages:

* Home
* About Us
* Hotel Gallery
* Our Rooms
* Sign Up
* Sign In
* Update account's info
